### Different Types of Dementia Screening Tests (GPCOG)

My teammates and I decided to research different types of Dementia Screening Tests. I researched about General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition, which is called GPCOG. This test is taken by both patient and guardian. The doctor asks the patient questions that require memory (drawing a specific time in a clock, memorizing a street address, etc).
