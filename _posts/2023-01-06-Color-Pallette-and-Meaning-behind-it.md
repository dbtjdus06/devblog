## Introduction

---

When we are designing an app, we need to pick colors that would be part of the app. Color is an important factor because it chooses how the first impression would be when our users first use the app.

### Why these colors?

When I was designing Mini-Cog, I wanted a color that gives warmth. When I searched for it, I found out that orange is a warm and enthusiastic color. This is why I decided to use orange.

I wanted to use green because it means luck, health, and safety. I thought it is a color that would represent Mini-Cog.

Lastly, I believed that white can irritate eyes so I chose beige as a background.

For semantic colors, I used dark red, dark orange, dark blue, and dark green so that the signs would not stand out too much.
