## What is Mini-Cog and why was it needed in South Korea?

---

Mini-Cog is a dementia screening test that can be done in just 3 minutes at home. My teammates and I decided to make Korean version of Minicog because all of the dementia screening test apps in Korea are hard for an elderly person to use.

Why Mini-Cog?
We had a research on different types of dementia screening tests and found out that Minicog is the easiest and simplest of them all. This is a test that can be done alone, and it doesn't take long, so we thought it would be convenient.

The test begins with memorizing words. It gives you three random words (you can see the words again if you want to).

Next is clock drawing.

You will be given specific time and asked to draw it. You can erase with the arrow right next to the clock, and it is necessary to draw numbers and clock hands. If you draw them all correctly you get 2 points, and if you get only one of them right, you will get 1 point. If you fail to draw both of them, you will not get any points.

After drawing your clock, you will be asked about the words.
