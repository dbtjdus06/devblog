## Introduction

I believe brain reserve and cognitive reserve are key factors for preventing Alzheimer's disease. And I would like to find out more about them in this blog post.

## What is Brain Reserve?

---

Based on what I've read and researched, I believe brain reserve is considered to be dependent on the structural characteristics of the brain. Having larger brain may lower your chances of getting dementia. To improve your brain reserve, early education, mental stimulation, and exercise can be helpful.

## What is Cognitive Reserve?

---

Cognitive reserve is about people reserving thier thinking abilities during their life time protects them from the decline in mental capactiy that comes with aging and brain diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or a stroke. It surprises me that individuals with higher education is less likely to get Alzheimer's disease.
