## Introduction

---

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most widely applied test for dementia screening. Since the intellectual property rights of the MMSE were transferred to Psychological Assessment Resources in 2001, it has become less accessible and useful

This systematic review and meta-analysis included 149 studies that assessed the accuracy of theMMSE and 10 other screening tests for the detection of dementia. Compared with other screening tests, the Mini-Cog test and the ACE-R had better diagnostic performance for dementia, and the MoCA had better diagnostic performance for MCI. The Mini-Cog test is relatively simple and short compared with the MMSE.
