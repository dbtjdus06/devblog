## What is GPCOG?

---

GPCOG is a short screening test for dementia. It stands for General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition.

## How does it work?

---
Usually, the screening test can be done with guardians at home, but patients can also visit doctors for a diagnostic workup. Patients are asked a few questions that require their memories. For example, they are asked to memorize a street address. After a few minutes, they are told to say what they have memorized. Based on the accuracy, doctors score their answers. At the end of the test, patients' guardians are asked about the patient. For instance, compared to 10 years ago, how they are having more difficulty in finding the right word. Using this conversation, the doctors know if their patients are having dementia.
