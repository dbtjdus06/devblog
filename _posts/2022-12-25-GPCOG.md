## Screening Test

---

A screening test detects potential diseases or disorders. GPCOG(General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition) is a short screening test for dementia. Since it takes shorter time than other tests, it is widely used today.

## How does GPCOG work?

The screening test can be done with guardians at home, but patients can also visit doctors for a diagnostic workup. Patients are asked a few questions that require their memory, language, visuospatial, and other daily living functions.

For example, they are asked to memorize a street address and are told to say what they have memorized. Based on the accuracy, doctors score their answers. If they get right, they earn 1 point. At the end of the test, patients' guardians are asked about the patient. For instance, compared to 10 years ago, how they are having more difficulties in finding a right word. The doctors also record their answers and score them. Out of 15 points, 9 for patients' answers and 6 for guardians' answers, doctors make diagnosis.
