## Introduction

A few days ago, I found a dementia screening test app. Through this blog, I will write about some things that cause difficulties in this app and how they can be fixed.

## Difficulty 1

The first thing I noticed was the login process this app wanted me (or guardians/patients) to get through. There were nine steps that I thought would be too complicated for a patient with dementia to create an account. My teammates and I decided to get rid of some steps so that logging in would be faster and easier.

## Difficulty 2

After I logged in, I tried the test. However, the way it was designed was not efficient. First of all, there were too many words in a question and half of them were useless. Additionally, the app offers audio that reads the question, but it is too slow.

In Figma, I designed my version of the test. I added a save button and used a white background for the question to be easily readable. I also thought that the setting button would be helpful so that people who do not want the audio can turn it off.
